## Lincoln Park Housing Market Price Prediction
Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts housing prices in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago. The model is built using historical housing data, including features such as property size, location, amenities, and market trends. The goal is to provide accurate price predictions that can assist potential buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals in making informed decisions.

## Data
The dataset used for this model includes historical sales data from Lincoln Park, sourced from [relevant data sources]. Key features in the dataset include:

Property Size (sq ft)
Number of Bedrooms/Bathrooms
Year Built
Lot Size
Proximity to Public Transport
Market Trends
Neighborhood Characteristics
Data Preprocessing: The data has been cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.

## Model
The model is built using (algorithm stack TBD) . The workflow includes:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the distribution of features and target variable.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features that improve model performance.
Model Training: Using the training data to fit the model.
Model Evaluation: Assessing model accuracy using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R².
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model performance.
Usage

To use the model to predict housing prices, run the following script:
```bash
python predict.py --input "path_to_your_input_data.csv"
# Replace path_to_your_input_data.csv with the path to your data file. The script will output predictions based on the trained model.
```

## Jupyter Notebooks
For an interactive experience, you can also explore the Jupyter notebooks included in this repository. These notebooks provide detailed steps from data exploration to model training and evaluation.

## Results
The model has been evaluated on a test dataset and achieved the following results:

RMSE: XX.XX
MAE: XX.XX
R² Score: XX.XX
These metrics indicate that the model performs well in predicting housing prices in Lincoln Park. Further improvements can be made by incorporating more recent data and additional features.
